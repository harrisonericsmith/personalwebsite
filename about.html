        <p>I'm a b2c software founder based in Halifax, Canada.</p>

        <p>I'm currently building <a href="https://dear.life">Dear Life</a> (2020-present). Our mission is to showcase every life story around the world. Our vision is to capture a version of you that forever outlasts the physical realm.</p>

        <p>I previously built Oneposte (2018-2020). It was a social network that paid you every time somoeone viewed your post. Our mission was to empower creators. It failed and taught me a lot.</p>

        <p>I've always been inspired by interesting work and the people who did it. I don't know why (yet). I spent endless hours as a child researching various careers and strategizing my path. I slowly but naturally became drawn to business, research, and techical innovation - all encompassed by foundership. It's an effortless obsession and I love every second.</p>

        <p>A few topics that I'm curious to learn more about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Decoding the association between neural patterns and conscious thoughts</li>
            <li>Web3</li>
            <li>General psychology</li>
            <li>Longevity improvement</li>
            <li>Life optimization</li>
            <li>Aritstic exploration</li>
            <li>Neural networks</li>
            <li>Improving the education system</li>
            <li>Future of work</li>
        </ul>
