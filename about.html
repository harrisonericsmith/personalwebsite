        <p>I'm a b2c software founder based in Halifax, Canada.</p>
        <p>I'm currently building <a href="https://dear.life">Dear Life</a> (2020-present). Our mission is to chronicle every life story around the world. We leverage user input, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing. Our vision is to offer digital immortality.</p>
        <p>I previously built Oneposte (2018-2020). It was a social network that paid you every time somoeone viewed your post. Our mission was to empower creators. It failed and taught me a lot.</p>
        <p>A list of things that I'm interested in learning more about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Decoding the association between neural patterns and conscious thoughts</li>
            <li>Web3</li>
            <li>General psychology</li>
            <li>Longevity improvement</li>
            <li>Life optimization</li>
            <li>Aritstic exploration</li>
            <li>Neural networks</li>
        </ul>
