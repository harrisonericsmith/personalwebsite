        <p> I work at <a href="https://dear.life">Dear Life</a>. I think it's one of the best places in the world you could work:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Purpose:</b> Our mission is to showcase every life story around the world. Our vision is to capture a version of you that forever outlasts the physical realm.</li>
            <li><b>Challenge:</b> We leverage user input, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing to automatically chronicle your life story from your media repositories.</li>
            <li><b>Mentorship:</b> Learn from some of Canada's top entrepreneurs, engineers, and investors in a diverse setting.</li>
            <li><b>Autonomy:</b> We're small (and growing fast) so there's plenty of interesting work to go around.</li>
            <li><b>Location:</b> We're fully remote, so you can join us anywhere in the world!</li>
        </ul>
