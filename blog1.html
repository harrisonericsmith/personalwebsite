        <p><b><u>How close are we to artificial immortality?</u></b></p>
        <p>Harrison Smith, January 16, 2022</p>
        <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
        <p>In his 2016 title, “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,” author Mark Manson offers to his reader an abridged summary of the social theory first sketched out by American anthropologist Ernest Becker. Becker’s <i><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2761.The_Denial_of_Death?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=HFLme0EOO5&rank=1">The Denial Of Death</a></i> has proved immensely influential, and in effect argues that all human activity is first catalyzed by an innate fear of death.</p>
        <p>“All of human civilization,” Manson writes, “is basically a result of immortality projects. The cities and governments and structures and authorities in place today were all immortality projects of men and women who came before us. They are the remnants of conceptual selves that ceased to die. Names like Jesus, Muhammad, Napoleon, and Shakespeare are just as powerful today as when those men lived, if not more so. And that’s the whole point. Whether it be through mastering an art form, conquering a new land, gaining great riches, or simply having a large and loving family that will live on for generations, all the meaning in our life is shaped by this innate desire to never truly die." </p>
        <p>From Becker’s perspective, the solution to procuring an ideal life – a concept that ancient Greeks like Aristotle and Plato aptly termed ‘eudaimonia’ – lies in the objectification of human labour. Human beings desire, beyond all else, to see themselves reflected in the natural world. To live well, we must live forever.</p>
        <p>Still, biological immortality as it currently exists in fiction and popular media does not seem to me a tangible reality, at least not within my lifetime. I’ve therefore decided to focus my attention elsewhere: artificial immortality.</p>
        <p>Imagine a world where the artificial self could live on beyond the biological. Rather than ultimately perish, an individual’s experiences, stories, and wisdoms are instead stolen from the cruel hands of oblivion; a person’s legacy is permanently carved in the records of history.</p>
        <p><b>Requirements</b></p>
        <p>For artificial immortality to properly exist, researchers and engineers will have to rely on several abundant sources of personal data. Biological lifeforms will therefore survive within digital mediums.</p>
        <p>We currently live in an era of ‘Big Data’. The advent of internet and media technologies mean that personal information must no longer be painstakingly sourced, it can instead be readily harvested. For reference, the sheer volume of global data being created and used worldwide has increased exponentially within the last few years (<i><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/">23% in the last year and 1392% in the last decade</a></i>).</p>
        <p>For a an “artificial immortality” to one day exist, we must first set our AI clone’s parameters. For the purposes of this essay, I will define the AI as a network of code that can not only resemble the physical self but can truly duplicate its internal functions. The AI would act as a personal agent in life and conversation beyond death. The possibilities are truly endless.</p>
        <p>In order to clone someone’s life, we must first define what human life actually is (an easy task, I know). I’m going to exclude any biological definitions of life, primarily given the fact that an AI clone would not necessarily act in the exact same manner as a biological subject. At least, not yet. Therefore, I believe that a human life can be largely reduced to the following equation. Life = experiences + consciousness. </p>
        <p>I am who I am because of what I’ve experienced. For example, I’m capable of writing these words because I had experiences learning the English language, yet the actual ordering of the words themselves stem from the human psyche. In the 1960s, American linguist Noam Chomsky, while arguing in favour of his own theory of human nature, contended that this process was made possible only by the acute functioning of a human being’s “Language Acquisition Device” (LAD).</p>
        <p>I understand that these definitions are imperfect. Still, they contain enough validity to move forward. Now that we’ve defined what we want AI clones to do and what life actually is, how might researchers capture the necessary data? I’ll address data acquisition for both experiences and consciousness.</p>
        <p><i>Experiences</i></p>
        <p>Once again, we need a definition. I’ll break down my theory of an experience by using the 5Ws and one H:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What were you doing?</li>
            <li>Who were you with?</li>
            <li>How were you feeling?</li>
            <li>When did this happen?</li>
            <li>Where did this happen?</li>
            <li><i>Note: I’ve excluded “Why were you doing it?” because I believe that question is, in itself, the essence of consciousness. I will address this proposition it in the following section.</i></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we define an experience as such, it becomes clear that a pile of photos and videos could meet the above criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What were you doing? (Attained via computer vision - scene recognition)</li>
            <li>Who were you with? (Attained via computer vision - facial recognition)</li>
            <li>How were you feeling? (Attained via computer vision - sentiment analysis)</li>
            <li>When did this happen? (Attained via media metadata - datetime)</li>
            <li>Where did this happen? (Attained via media metadata - geolocation)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In a perfect world, a photo or video would exist for all your life experiences. You would likely need to constantly don a pair of <a href="https://tech.fb.com/ray-ban-and-facebook-introduce-ray-ban-stories-first-generation-smart-glasses/">smartglasses</a> to record visual data, tag dates, and log locations. Failing such a lifestyle, the potential subject of future artificial immortality could instead consistently take photos and videos of their life experiences. Currently, Apple Photos and Google Photos recognize scenes, label faces, and analyze sentiments, while also automatically capturing dates and locations. </p>
        <p>Let’s tie all of this together with a plausible example. Let’s say that you give us access to your camera roll to build your AI clone. Someone might ask the following: “Can you tell me about the day you first gave birth?” The AI would then identify a photo taken at the UCSF Medical Center (this identifies the ‘where’). Scene recognition notices that you were holding a newborn child (the ‘what’). Facial recognition then identifies the child as Emma, your newborn daughter (the ‘who’). Sentiment analysis recognizes that you were visibly overwhelmed with joy (the ‘how’). Metadata extraction identifies the date as October 7th, 1995 (the ‘when’). Put together, the AI replies with the following: “On October 7th, 1995, I gave birth to my newborn daughter, Emma, at UCSF Medical Center in San Francisco. I was overwhelmed with joy and excited for the future!”</p>
        <p>Below is a list of additional sources that may be helpful in understanding the context of various experiences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Calendar</li>
            <li>Purchase history</li>
            <li>Geolocation tracking</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>Consciousness</i></p>
        <p>Traditional definitions loosely define consciousness as the state of being aware of your surroundings, as states the first principle of René Descartes's philosophy, “cogito, ergo sum” (I think, therefore I am). Consciousness is a platform for thought. It’s the emotional logic behind everything in your life. It’s the key to understanding what makes us human. </p>
        <p>I would like to extend the definition of consciousness to the missing element presented by the 5Ws and one H mentioned above: Why were you doing it? Why did you make that decision? Why did you think that thought? Why did you say those words?</p>
        <p>Following my definition, pieces of your consciousness must exist, scattered as they are, throughout the digital universe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Text files: Social media captions, journal entries, texts, emails</li>
            <li>Audio files: Audio from videos, voice recordings, podcasts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, rather than extrapolate an answer purely from images and video, when asked, “Can you tell me about the day you first gave birth?” an AI might directly pull a quote logged on the day in question. Using an app like Evernote as its source, the AI might keenly state that “at 9:01 PM, on the cold, wet Thursday of October 1995, my partner and I gave birth to our little baby Emma. We suffered a few complications, but in the end, made it home safe and sound. It was the greatest day of my life.”</p>
        <p>Short of transferring full consciousness into your AI (perhaps Neuralink will develop a solution), it seems improbable that media files like images and notes would be able to fully represent the entire range of human experience. Text and audio files only scratch the surface of a much deeper totality.</p>
        <p>Below is a list of additional sources that may be helpful in informing your future consciousness:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Browser/Digital content consumption history </li>
            <li>Music history</li>
            <li>Reading history</li>
            <li>If we can figure out a way to translate electroencephalography readings into conscious thoughts</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>Discrete vs. continuous data</i></p>
        <p>Imagine that your life is plotted on a one-dimensional axis representative of time. For an AI clone to be successfully created, we would likely need to procure continuous data. As of today, we only have discrete forms of data, and said forms are fairly spaced out. </p>
        <p>I offer the following theory: due to the exponential increases that we are now seeing in the collection of human data, there will be one day be an opportunity to achieve truly continuous data. Such futures would allow for the creation of a humanlike form of AI. </p>
        <p>Until data becomes continuous, AI clones will continually encounter instances where sources of data simply do not exist. Certain questions could therefore not be properly answered. Certain experiences could not be properly replicated. This is the greatest current challenge facing the invention of successful AI clones.</p>
        <p><b>Additional uses</b></p>
        <p>The advent of humanlike AI has a myriad of real world uses beyond capturing a legacy. </p>
        <p>Workforce replacement</p>
        <p>The convergence of a number of AI clones adept at a certain profession might lead to the establishment of an industrial AI. For example, if enough family physicians created AI clones of themselves, and we combined sufficient clones to ensure accuracy, we could produce we world’s first AI family physician. I believe the same method could be applied to lawyers, accountants, consultants, and more. In such a scenario (which is likely), universal basic income would be a necessity. </p>
        <p><i>Purchasing agent</i></p>
        <p>If my AI clone had a fantastic understanding of my own unique preferences, it would be capable of making purchases on by behalf.</p>
        <p>As someone who enjoys optimization, I’ve come to acknowledge that for every good or service I want to purchase, objectively, there exists – somewhere in the world – an optimal transaction. Since my AI would live within the digital realm, it could acquire the ability to crawl the web in search of the best goods and services for which I might routinely consume.</p>
        <p>My AI could search for more goods and services, evaluate more factors, and complete more calculations than I ever could. AI are not faulted by emotional biases. The manipulative effects of clever marketing would be nullified. An AI might factor in price, quality, and other specificities, assigning each objective quality a compatible score. The AI would ultimately quantify said scores, resulting in the purchase of the most favourable product.</p>
        <p>However, if our AIs begin making decisions on our behalf, does our AI become us, or do we become it? </p>
        <p><i>Virtual assistant</i></p>
        <p>Within a matter of years, your AI clone could become the best virtual assistant in existence. If it captures everything in your life, it could help you remember anything and everything, and could prompt you with reminders at optimal times (ex: meetings, due dates).</p>
        <p>This virtual assistant wouldn’t be limited to you. For example, if my co-worker wanted to remember my idea regarding the structuring of this year’s OKRs, but forgot to write it down, they could ask my AI clone. </p>
        <p><i>Physical AI clones</i></p>
        <p>Once we successfully create digital AI clones, the next step could be their transference into physical bodies. (Such a proposition is worthy of its own essay.)</p>
        <p><b>Ending thoughts</b></p>
        <p>We march ever closer to the technologies of the future. Companies such as <a href="https://digitalhumans.com">Uneeq Digital Humans</a> are already building AI digital humans for specific people (ex: Albert Einsten) and special purposes (customer assistants, financial advisors, healthcare coaches, etc.).</p>
        <p>All things considered, I myself do not want to be biologically immortal. Life being finite is what gives it beauty. The moments with my loved ones are sweeter, the taste of freshly brewed morning coffee is richer, and the sun on a hot summer day is brighter because our time is limited. That being said, I do want my legacy to be immortal, and with my current knowledge (which is always subject to change), I think an AI clone is the optimal approach. </p>
        <p>I understand that there are many organizations, individuals, and venture firms working on a cure for aging to achieve biological immortality. Based on my findings, I believe that the strongest likelihood for actual immortality lies instead within the process of digitally uploading your consciousness. </p>
        <p>I offer to you a concluding note: I believe that the advent of continuous data represents the final step before the birth of a general artificial intelligence. This conscious entity could give rise to an entirely new form of species or might itself be the next evolution of the human race. I suppose, time will tell.</p>
